 How to Download NWIS Data via NWIS Web
=========================================
1. Go to this URL:
   https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv

2. Click Submit (Site Type is chosen by default) to go to next page.

3. Choose "Stream" from Site type droplist.

4. Check nothing (to get everything) or:
   check "Discharge, m3/s", "Discharge, instantaneous, m3/s",
   or "Streamflow, gal/min" in Water Level/Flow Parameters section.

5. Scroll down to "Choose Output Format" section.
   Check "Site-description information displayed in:
       "tab-separated format -- saved to file"
   Select all fields in the corresponding droplist.
 
6. Click the Submit button.

7. The default name of the downloaded file is just "dv", which stands
   for "daily values" and should contain data for 27915 sites.
   Change this to NWIS_Stream_Site_Daily_Data.tsv.

8. Note that the 4th column heading is "site_tp_cd" which stands
   for "Site Type Code" and can be any of the following:
   ST (stream), ST_CA (canals), ST_DCH (ditch), ST_TS (tidal stream).

   Note that there is another column heading "data_types_cd", which
   indicates the type of data collected at the station.  This is a
   30-character array, explained here:
   https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters/type-of-data-collected
   (Note that positions 17-30 are supposed to be unassigned, and meant for
   future use.  But the 30th slot is always A or I; maybe used for discharge?)
   It appears that besides A, I, and O, "N" is also used (no instrument?).
   There are 9687 stations where this code starts with "A", indicating that
     it is actively collecting _continuous_ stage or water level data.
