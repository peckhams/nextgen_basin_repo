                 THE ARS WATER DATA BASE



The ARS Water Data Base is a collection of precipitation and 
streamflow data from small agricultural watersheds in the United 
States.  This national archive of variable time-series readings for 
precipitation and runoff contains sufficient detail to reconstruct 
storm hydrographs and hyetographs.  There are currently about 14,000 
station years of data stored in the data base.  Watersheds used as 
study areas range from .2 hectare (0.5 acres) to 12,400 square 
kilometers (4,786 square miles).  Raingage networks range from one 
station per watershed to over 200 stations.  The period of record 
for individual watersheds vary from 1 to 50 years.  Some watersheds 
have been in continuous operation since the mid 1930's.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is a research organization.  
There are no legal mandates for the agency to collect or to distribute 
data collected for specific research projects.  These data are being 
made available to the research community to promote the general 
knowledge of the processes relating to our country's natural resources.  
ANY PUBLICATIONS WHICH ARE GENERATED FROM THESE DATA SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE 
THE ARS AS THE SOURCE.  In addition we would like to request that 
you notify the Water Data Center of all publications, including 
disertations, which use or refer to these data.  Citations may be 
sent by email to glenn.moglen@ars.usda.gov or by mail to:

Your cooperation in this matter will promote further research and 
cooperation, help to validate the usefulness of the ARS data 
collection activities and influence  agency policy regarding future 
data collection.  

Various types of ancillary data are also maintained with the 
precipitation and streamflow.  These include air temperature, land 
management practices, topograhy and soils information.

PRODUCTS

The primary products of the ARS Water Data Base are calendar years 
of precipitation and streamflow in variable time-series format.  
Other products include daily values, peak flow amounts, maximum- 
minimum daily air temperature, and textual files containing 
watershed descriptive information, land use and soils.

DATA REQUESTS

The Water Data Center has the ability to provide data in several 
different forms.  The data can be moved to various media and 
transmitted to the user.  Output media include various diskette 
types, magnetic tapes and hardcopy print.  

For help determining what data would be useful for your research 
project and for output on other media, you may contact:

USING THIS SYSTEM

Before downloading huge amounts of data from the ARS Water Data 
Base,  you should first review the text files included in this 
directory.  They include:

INDEX OF ARS EXPERIMENTAL WATERSHEDS:   index.txt

This report includes identification information on all watersheds 
operated by the ARS.  Only some of these are included in the ARS 
Water Data Base.  They are so indicated in the column titled ARS 
Water Data Base.  Other watersheds will not have data available 
here or through the Water Data Center.  This index is particularly 
important since it relates watershed names with the indexing system 
used by the Water Data Center.  Each  location has been assigned a 
number.  The data for that location will be stored in a sub- 
directory coded as LXX where XX is the location number.  The index 
also indicates the watershed number used by the WDC.  Data for a 
particular watershed will be stored in a compressed file named 
WSXXXXX.zip  where XXXXX is the watershed number assigned by the WDC.  
Although not included in the index, rain gage information will be 
stored in compressed files named RGXXXXXX.zip where XXXXXX is a 6- 
character identification of the rain gage station.

The Index also provides information such as latitude-longitude for 
each of the watersheds, acreage, the period-of-record for each 
acreage.  Multiple entries for a particular watershed will either 
indicate that the acreage designated for the watershed changed or 
there was a break in operations of the watershed.


STATION TABLE FOR THE ARS WATER DATA BASE:   station.txt

This report indicates the period of record for each recording 
station represented in the ARS Water Data Base.  The data for a 
particular station will be stored in a single compressed file. 


FORMAT INFORMATION FOR VARIOUS RECORD TYPES:   format.txt

Format information identifying fields and their length will be 
included in this file for all files except those ending with the 
extension .txt

TYPES OF FILES

As indicated in the previous section data has been stored by 
location number in the form, LXX where XX is the location number.  
In each subdirectory, there will be various files using the 
following naming conventions:

Runoff data: WSXXX.zip  where XXX is the watershed number assigned 
by the WDC.  This number may or may not correspond to a naming 
convention used in common literature.

Rainfall data: RGXXXXXX.zip where XXXXXX is the rain gage station 
identification.

Maximum-minimum daily air temperature: MMTXXXXX.zip  where XXXXX is the 
watershed number assigned by the WDC.

Ancillary text files:  NOTXXXXX.txt   where XXXXX is the watershed 
number assigned by the WDC.  These files will contain textual 
information including latitude-longitude, name  commonly used in 
literature, acreage, most commonly-associated rain gage(s) (if 
known by the WDC), a list of all rain gages on or near the 
watershed.  Land use, topography, and soils as known by the WDC. 

Topographic maps of the watersheds:  MAPXXXXX.zip  where XXXXX is the 
location/watershed number assigned by the WDC.  Map files are binary TIF
files.

NOT ALL FILE TYPES MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC WATERSHEDS.
