{"title":"ARS Water Database","body":"The ARS Water Data Base is a collection of precipitation and streamflow data from small agricultural watersheds in the United States.  This national archive of variable time-series readings for precipitation and runoff contains sufficient detail to reconstruct storm hydrographs and hyetographs.  There are currently about 14,000 station years of data stored in the data base.  Watersheds used as study areas range from 0.2 hectare (0.5 acres) to 12,400 square kilometers (4,786 square miles).  Raingage networks range from one station per watershed to over 200 stations.  The period of record for individual watersheds vary from 1 to 50 years.  Some watersheds have been in continuous operation since the mid 1930\u0027s.","tags":["Water","NP211","NP212","rainfall-runoff"],"license":"cc-zero","data_dictionary":{"value":"https:\/\/data.nal.usda.gov\/dataset\/ars-water-database\/resource\/c3b8a7d2-6d00-4ef5-b6a1-6a873c6d8321","format":"html","safe_value":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/data.nal.usda.gov\/dataset\/ars-water-database\/resource\/c3b8a7d2-6d00-4ef5-b6a1-6a873c6d8321\u0022\u003Ehttps:\/\/data.nal.usda.gov\/dataset\/ars-water-database\/resource\/c3b8a7d2-6...\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n"},"contact_name":"Moglen, Glenn","contact_email":"Glenn.Moglen@ars.usda.gov","public_access_level":"public"}
