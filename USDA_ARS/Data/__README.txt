The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has for many years been collecting
data for a set of 771 agricultural watersheds in their Experimental Watershed
Network.  See: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019WR026473

Many of these watersheds will be familiar to hydrologists due to the studies
for which their data was used, such as:

Goodwin Creek, MS
Little River, GA
Little Washita, OK
Reynolds Creek, ID
Walnut Gulch, AZ

Data for these watersheds can be downloaded from the USDA at:
   https://agdatacommons.nal.usda.gov/articles/dataset/ARS_Water_Database/24660771

Data can also be found in the USDA's data service called STEWARDS.

Links to more information for some of these watersheds can be found in
the USDA_ARS/URLs folder.

The basic metadata is in the files INDEX.txt and inventor.txt.
You can optionally download a zip file called "ars_water.zip" that has
a filesize of 120.3 MB and which contains additional information
for each watershed.

I'm not sure yet about the horizontal and vertical datums used;
maybe NAD83 and GRS80 ellipsoid.

Until recently, the USDA ARS Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory (HRSL)
maintained a web page for the stations/gauges in each US state, with links
to information. These web pages were apparently front ends for FTP sites
and could be reached by clicking on the map or links on this web page:
   https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/hydrology-and-remote-sensing-laboratory/docs/ars-water-database/services/
However, this web page now says that the underlying FTP site has been disabled
and users are redirected to this page:
   https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/ars-water-database

The previous links were of the form:
