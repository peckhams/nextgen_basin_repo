ARS	Agricultural Research Service	ARS-PAMC-PAMCWE38	PAMCWE38		The PAMCWE38 site is a stream flow monitoring station on a small subwatershed of the East Mahantango Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River about 30 km north of Harrisburg, PA .  Flow control is provided by a series of V-notch weirs.  An upper, 4’ high, 5:1 broad-crested weir provides high-flow (>0.075 cubic meters per second) control, while a lower, 1.5’ sharp-crested weir provides low-flow (<0.075 cubic meters per second) control.	02050301	730	ha			40.7052595630	-76.587608694					NAD83							US	42	097										STEWARDS
