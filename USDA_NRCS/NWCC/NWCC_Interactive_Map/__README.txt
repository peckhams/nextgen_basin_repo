https://nwcc-apps.sc.egov.usda.gov/imap

2. In the upper right, for Map Mode, click on Station Inventory.

3. Go down to middle right and in Collection Networks panel,
   click on Check All link.  Notice that "Active Sites Only"
   checkbox is checked by default.  Notice that metadata for
   several different networks will be included, such as:
   SNOTEL (899), SCAN (212), SNOLITE (42), & Streamflow (953).

4. In upper left, notice the droplist labeled:
   Selected Stations: 4310

5. Right click on this droplist and choose:

6. Open the CSV file with a spreadsheet program.
   Sort the Network column in ascending order.
   Notice that different Networks use different IDs.
   The "Streamflow" network usually uses the USGS site ID.
   Note that the HUC column has 12-digit HUCs (HUC 12 codes).
