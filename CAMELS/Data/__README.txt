The CAMEL dataset is available at:
https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/camels.html

The CAMELS dataset contains information for 671 river basins.  All of these are contained within the GAGES-II Selected Basins v3, which has 1947 basins.  Moreover, the GAGES-II Selected Basins v3 is a subset of the GAGES-II Reference Basins, of which there are 2057.

An ESRI shapefile, which contains an attribute table with basic metadata for each basin, can be downloaded from:
    https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/camels/file.html
as the file "basin_set_full_res.zip".

On that same page there is a series of text files with filenames of the form
"camels_*.txt".  Each of these contains 672 lines: a header line and 671 lines
with additional info for each basin.  Data values in each line are delimited
with semicolons, starting with the 8-digit USGS gauge/site ID.
