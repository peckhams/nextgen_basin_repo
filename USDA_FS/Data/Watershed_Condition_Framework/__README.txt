The US Forest Service Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) main page is at:
  https://www.fs.usda.gov/naturalresources/watershed/condition_framework.shtml

On that WCF page, there is a link titled:
  "Download a table containing the WCC and Prioritization information"
This table was saved to a TSV file in the Data folder, called:
  Watershed_Condition_Framework_Basins.tsv
 
On that same WCF page, there is also a link titled:
  "download a shapefile with WCC and Prioritization information"
The zipped size of this shapefile is 227 MB, while the unzipped size
is 340.9 MB.  Due to its size, this file is not included in the repo.
However, the attribute table for this shapefile was saved to a CSV file
using QGIS and included in the "_New" folder as the file:
  Watershed_Condition_Framework_info.csv
