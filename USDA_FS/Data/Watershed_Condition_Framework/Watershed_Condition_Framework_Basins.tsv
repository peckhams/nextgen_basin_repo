The key concerns and conditions affecting watershed condition affect only the Southern portion of the L.F. Huntington and the Northern portion of Lowry Water. This includes Reeder Canyon northward to the Miller Flat area. These two sub-watersheds contain both recreation and wetland corridors which are home to 50 percent of the wetlands existing on the Manti-La Sal NF and host some of the heaviest visitation found on the forest. Former State of Utah sections 16 and 32 in T15 South, R6 East contain many of these wetlands.  These sections became part of the National Forest System several years ago, but for decades they were used without restriction by visitors.  Several miles of user created roads and motorized trails in these sections are negatively impacting wetlands. The Lowry Water road (NFSR 50038) closely parallels Lowry Water Creek between Joes Valley and Potters Ponds and has three bridge crossings.  The northern two miles of this road is also directly impacting wetlands and the riparian area.  Both drainages provide water for culinary, industrial, and agricultural uses to Emery County. Collectively, these sub-watersheds have impaired ratings for habitat fragmentation, exotic and invasive species, loss of forest cover, mass wasting, and proximity to water. Fish are prevented from moving freely throughout the Left Fork of Huntington Creek aquatic ecosystem due to several reservoirs located in the Left Fork watershed.  There are little to no projects that could be undertaken to mitigate the impaired condition of habitat fragmentation. Exotic and invasive species within the Left Fork of Huntington Creek aquatic ecosystem is typified by the presence of whirling disease and non-native fish species.  Native fish populations are isolated and protected from exotic and invasive species by barriers. There are no additional projects that could reasonably be undertaken to mitigate this impaired condition.	 	9/30/2011	12/31/2015	 	 	 	Y

Reducing road densities would improve water quality by reducing sediment inputs to streams and would reduce risk of future road or culver failures that could further impair the ecosystem.  NEPA covering watershed improvement work is complete (includes over 50 miles of road decommissioning and/or storage) which was done in conjunction with the Fallen Bear Project, incorporating timber, engineering, wildlife and fuels activities.  Planned watershed improvement work aligns with national and regional strategies and forest plan. Watershed is within the same 5th code HUC as future District priority watersheds (e.g. Gold Creek). High runoff and or flooding may cause road/culvert or bridge failure. Implementation of road work would create jobs for contractors. Watershed improvement work would be cost effective if done in conjunction with current timber sale contract work within the area.  On-the-ground accomplishments would be realized in FY12 and FY13.  The Bruin Creek watershed currently has a WCATT watershed condition rating of “FAR”.  By reducing road densities within the HUC the watershed condition rating would move closer to a “FP” condition.  If road densities are not reduced there would be a risk of the watershed condition moving to an “IF” condition if road failures were to occur increasing stream sedimentation and negatively impacting fish habitat.

Bare soil is a source of sediment to creeks and streams as well as dust, which can settle on the leaves of vegetation and on the surface of waterbodies.  Overall route density in the watershed is relatively high (4.4 miles/square mile).  Road density within 300 feet of streams and water bodies is considered poor at 4.08 miles/square mile. The risk of tree mortality is high, with a bark beetle infestation affecting hundreds of acres in 8,000-9,000 ft elevation range, including parts of June Mountain and Glass Creek Meadow.

The strategy was a scientifically based approach to conserve streams currently in good condition and to restore impaired streams to improve fish habitat and salmonid populations.  Anchor habitat was identified for spring and fall Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead trout, all listed as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.  This strategy is the foundation for the Still Creek Watershed Restoration Action Plan. Still Creek Watershed is a priority watershed because: 1) Top priority for restoration by the Sandy River Basin Partners; 2) Start up funding already obligated ($244K), initiation of WCF restoration could begin immediately; 3) TEAMS Enterprise completing Still Creek Rehabilitation plans (detailed site plans), including flood plain enhancements, riparian plantings, and side channels restoration; 4) Archaeology surveys and SHPO consultation in progress; 5) Restoration covered under Aquatic Restoration Biological Opinion (ARBO), 6) Integrated restoration including: instream restoration, riparian plantings, invasive plant removal, road restoration, and rec. resident compliance will collectively result in whole watershed restoration; 7) 21 years of smolt monitoring and 9 years of spawning surveys in Still Creek document baseline conditions for effectiveness/biological monitoring; 8)100% of planned road decommissioning and restoration completed in 2011; 9) Invasive plants mapped and treatment plan in place for the Sandy River Basin by the Sandy Basin Vegetation Restoration Coalition (SBVRC); 10) Recreational resident (Cool Creek Tract) EA completed in Still Creek in 2009.  Improvement for water and sewer infrastructure within the watershed is in progress; 11) Zigzag Watershed analysis was completed in 1995 & 2004 which provided restoration strategies for downed wood and reforestation.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>METRO</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Oregon Depart. of Fish and Wildlife </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Sandy River Basin Watershed Council </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>USDI Bureau of Land Management </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Western Rivers Conservancy </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>The Freshwater Trust </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Portland Water Bureau </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Northwest Steelheaders</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Nature Conservancy </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>National Marine Fisheries Service </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2016	19	3699381	 	Y

This area is of particular importance to recreation because on one end, it abuts Lassen Volcanic National Park, and on the other, it is a short distance from Burney Falls State Park.  Often, all three of these are a part of peoples’ vacations.The consequences of such intense use of the area are that unmanaged recreation and high use of system and user-created roads have caused water quality and bank stability problems.  Riparian vegetation near high-use areas has been trampled and otherwise damaged and removed.  The watershed is particularly prone to surface disturbances because it is on a lahar (debris flow buoyed by volcanic gasses) from the 1915-1916 Mt. Lassen eruptions. BHCCFWG (the Burney Hat Creek Community Forest and Watershed Group - a local stakeholder group to which Lassen NF belongs - see partnerships section for a partial list of participating organizations) is partnering with another R5 collaboration to form the Sierra Cascades All Lands Enhancement Demonstration (SCALE).  The existence of both of these groups means that there is a significant amount of collaboration in all areas of the community.   The local NRCS (also part of SCALE) has indicated that they are considering selecting sub-watersheds downstream in the larger Hat Creek Watershed as their Priority Watersheds.  Therefore, the potential for meaningful and mutually beneficial collaborative projects exists. Lower Hat Creek is designated and managed by the California Department of Fish and Game as a Wild Trout Fishery, and projects on it are being implemented under the auspices of BHCCFWG.  By focusing on the headwaters, we are compliment downstream efforts to improve aquatic habitat. Finally, several vegetation management projects are being planned for this area to restore ecological conditions and improve ecological services. 	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Burney Fire District (BHCCFWG Member)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>NRCS (BHCCFWG Member)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Pit River Tribe (BHCCFWG Member)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Sierra Pacific Industries (BHCCFWG Membe</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Sierra Institute for Community and Envir</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>PG&amp;E (BHCCFWG Member)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Lassen Volcanic National Park (BHCCFWG M</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Fall River Resource Conservation Distric</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Fruit Growers (BHCCFWG Member)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	 	12/31/2024	3	6660000	 	Y

Poorer conditions are also due to impacts from irrigation diversions, roads, channelization, and grazing on private land. Most streams are de-watered in the lower reaches during the irrigation season, severely impacting fish habitat. Fire exclusion and livestock grazing have allowed canopy cover to increase, which has reduced the understory herbaceous cover. Aspen is present in pure stands and mixed with subalpine fir; however, most stands are dying out or being replaced by conifers. Older aspen stands are not regenerating. Many of the conifer stands in the area are old, with high tree densities and increasing mortality from insects and disease. Fire hazard is increasing in conifer stands. The Pinyon-Juniper group is functioning at high risk due to fire exclusion and grazing impacts that have allowed older, close-canopied stands to dominate, with fewer younger trees and herbaceous plants than desirable. Terrestrial habitat is functioning at risk in localized areas due to impacts to habitat from fire exclusion and introduced plant species.  • Important Ecological Values: The three subwatersheds support some of the last genetically pure Yellowstone cutthroat populations in the Raft River drainage. Cottam cinquefoil and Grouse Creek rockcress, Region 4 Sensitive species, are found in this area.  The cool sagebrush, grasslands, and forests provide habitat for sage grouse, while dry forests at lower elevations provide habitat for the Region 4 sensitive goshawk, and Townsend's big-eared bat.  	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2017	 	 	 	Y

Primary watershed concerns are for water quantity, aquatic biota, riparian-wetland vegetation, roads, trails, soils fire regime, forest cover rangeland vegetation and forest health and water quality.   Water quantity concerns arelate to multiple diversions and degraded riparian conditions in headwater areas. Some roads have deep ruts and are functioning as sediment sources. Soils, particularly in parks and meadows, have been negatively impacted and are experiencing erosion. Ponderosa pine stands are in fire condition class 3 and need to be moved into a less severe condition class. Aspen are also experiencing Sudden Aspen Decline and practices promoting regeneration are needed.

Upper Sleeping Child contains several sections of former private “checkerboard” sections that were recently acquired by the USFS. Management by former landowner included liquidation of the timber base with little resource consideration.  Sub-standard and poorly located roads built by the former land owner are in poor condition and are not needed for future timber management.  High severity fire activity in 2000 added to watershed sensitivity, precipitation effectiveness, and increased soil loss.  Road densities, watershed condition, and stream channel condition all fall short of Forest Plan desired conditions.  Bull Trout (Sleeping Child watershed), West Slope cutthroat (Rye Creek watershed), INFISH compliance and State Impaired Waters (303(d) listed) compliance would benefit/improve from road decomissioning and storage activities. Phase 1 of the Darby Lumber Lands project would include decommissioning of former landowner roads and historic FS roads in the Upper Sleeping Child and Rye Creek watersheds.  Total miles to be decomissioned are approximately 60 miles, split between 3 years of implementation (FY13 through FY15).   We are currently pursing additional partner funding for project implementation but is not guaranteed at this time. 	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Trout Unlimited</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	10/28/2011	9/30/2015	2	880000	 	Y

Travel routes are an issue where they contribute sediment to streams.  Aquatic species have not fully recovered to desired populations.  Whirling disease is affecting existing populations of Colorado Cutthroat trout and the population is non-sustaining naturally.  Fish need to be transplanted to maintain the population.

This area is of particular importance to recreation because on one end, it abuts Lassen Volcanic National Park, and on the other, it is a short distance from Burney Falls State Park.  Often, all three of these are a part of peoples’ vacations.The consequences of such intense use of the area are that unmanaged recreation and high use of system and user-created roads have caused water quality and bank stability problems.  Riparian vegetation near high-use areas has been trampled and otherwise damaged and removed.  The watershed is particularly prone to surface disturbances because it is on a lahar (debris flow buoyed by volcanic gasses) from the 1915-1916 Mt. Lassen eruptions. BHCCFWG (the Burney Hat Creek Community Forest and Watershed Group - a local stakeholder group to which Lassen NF belongs - see partnerships section for a partial list of participating organizations) is partnering with another R5 collaboration to form the Sierra Cascades All Lands Enhancement Demonstration (SCALE).  The existence of both of these groups means that there is a significant amount of collaboration in all areas of the community.   The local NRCS (also part of SCALE) has indicated that they are considering selecting sub-watersheds downstream in the larger Hat Creek Watershed as their Priority Watersheds.  Therefore, the potential for meaningful and mutually beneficial collaborative projects exists.

This area is of particular importance to recreation because on one end, it abuts Lassen Volcanic National Park, and on the other, it is a short distance from Burney Falls State Park.  Often, all three of these are a part of peoples’ vacations.The consequences of such intense use of the area are that unmanaged recreation and high use of system and user-created roads have caused water quality and bank stability problems.  Riparian vegetation near high-use areas has been trampled and otherwise damaged and removed.  The watershed is particularly prone to surface disturbances because it is on a lahar (debris flow buoyed by volcanic gasses) from the 1915-1916 Mt. Lassen eruptions. BHCCFWG (the Burney Hat Creek Community Forest and Watershed Group - a local stakeholder group to which Lassen NF belongs - see partnerships section for a partial list of participating organizations) is partnering with another R5 collaboration to form the Sierra Cascades All Lands Enhancement Demonstration (SCALE).  The existence of both of these groups means that there is a significant amount of collaboration in all areas of the community.   The local NRCS (also part of SCALE) has indicated that they are considering selecting sub-watersheds downstream in the larger Hat Creek Watershed as their Priority Watersheds.  Therefore, the potential for meaningful and mutually beneficial collaborative projects exists. Lower Hat Creek is designated and managed by the California Department of Fish and Game as a Wild Trout Fishery, and projects on it are being implemented under the auspices of BHCCFWG.  By focusing on the headwaters, we are compliment downstream efforts to improve aquatic habitat.

The Lost River flows through, above and below the limestone karst that underlies much of this watershed. As of July 2008, the Lost River cave system is the second longest cave in Indiana and the 26th longest in the US. One of the significant features of the system, a National Natural Landmark, is Wesley Chapel Gulf, located on National Forest System lands which is 8.3 acres large and forms a box canyon with bedrock walls, where the river briefly appears before once again disappearing below the surface. One Federally endangered species of bat, the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), has an identified hibernacula within the watershed.  The area hosts hibernacula for many other bats species. In addition, many Regional Forester Sensitive Species including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, karst invertebrates, and plants have been identified utilizing this area.  Tributaries and streams in this watershed flow into the East Fork White River which contains Regional Forester Sensitive Species and two endangered mussel species. 	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Lost River Watershed Project</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>NRCS</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2016	14	478925	 	Y

Cutthroat trout in the watershed are threatened by habitat degradation, rainbow trout hybridization and brook trout competition. Legacy road decommissioning is a high priority for the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The Little Belts Travel Plan has been completed and implementation of road decommissioning has commenced within the watershed.  The watershed was extensively logged resulting in high road densities which contribute chronic sediment to streams and disrupts the natural hydrologic function across the watershed. The L&C plans to continue road decommissioning work which will have the benefits of lowering the road density within the watershed, reducing the chronic sediment inputs to streams and improve hydrologic function of the drainage.  Another high sediment source is from winter traction sanding along State Highway 89 resulting in improper stream function and has degraded westslope cutthroat trout habitat. Potential partnerships will be Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks, Montana Department of Transportation, Meagher County Conservation District and Trout Unlimited.  	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Montan Fish Wildlife and Park</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	10/26/2011	10/1/2014	4	980000	 	Y

The Station Fire (Fall 2009) burned a major portion of the  vegetative cover and the soil surface. This has resulted in the Upper Big Tujunga Creek watershed (and all the subwatersheds of Big Tujunga Creek)  having precipitation events producing much higher than normal surface runoff and erosion. Under these conditions slopes and channels became even more unstable than normal. TheUpper  Big Tujunga Creek watershed had one hundred  percent of the watershed burned which included the higher forested elevations and lower slope and riparian areas. The following activities will be implemented in 2012 to contribute to improving watershed conditions:  plant 245 acres of native trees, release 241 acres of native trees planted in 2011, treat standing deadwood that poses a threat to humans and has potential to contribute to damaging floatable debris through administration of deck sales, noxious invasive weed treatment through partnerships and direct funding, decommission 3 miles of road, alleviate a resource/recreation issue related to the arroyo toad, and conduct trails maintenance work to reduce erosion and sediment from entering  Big Tujunga Creek.	 	 	 	 	176660	 	Y

The watershed is rated as condition class II.  This rating is primarily due to impacts related to Knutson Dam, which is located on the Mississippi River at the outlet of Cass Lake.  The dam has been in place since the late 1800s, was most recently rebuilt in 1946, and is owned and operated by the Chippewa National Forest.  The dam is in need a significant maintenance and has limited ability to manage flows at the high and low ends of the hydrograph.  This results in lake level changes that impact natural flow regimes, channel and shoreline conditions, and recreational access.  The dam is also a barrier to aquatic organism passage which is concern for state fishery managers and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, especially regarding game species and the Regional Forester Sensitive Species listed Greater Redhorse.  The watershed is a major tourism area and important resource for the local economy.  An important opportunity exists for the Forest to work with partners to perform needed maintenance and modify the dam in order to meet lake level targets, provide for fish passage, and facilitate recreational use.  Modification of Knutson Dam would improve watershed condition by improving a number of watershed attributes.  Other watershed indicators that need improvement in the basin include the road and trial system, riparian vegetation and fire regime.  Improvements to these indicators will move the Watershed to a Condition Class I.	 	10/26/2011	9/30/2020	4	1450000	 	Y

The Lost River flows through, above and below the limestone karst that underlies much of this watershed. As of July 2008, the Lost River cave system is the second longest cave in Indiana and the 26th longest in the US. One of the significant features of the system, a National Natural Landmark, is Wesley Chapel Gulf, located on National Forest System lands which is 8.3 acres large and forms a box canyon with bedrock walls, where the river briefly appears before once again disappearing below the surface. One Federally endangered species of bat, the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), has an identified hibernacula within the watershed.  The area hosts hibernacula for many other bats species. In addition, many Regional Forester Sensitive Species including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, karst invertebrates, and plants have been identified utilizing this area.  Tributaries and streams in this watershed flow into the East Fork White River which contains Regional Forester Sensitive Species and two endangered mussel species.  	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Lost River Watershed Project</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>NRCS</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2016	9	652650	 	Y

Poorer conditions are also due to impacts from irrigation diversions, roads, channelization, and grazing on private land. Most streams are de-watered in the lower reaches during the irrigation season, severely impacting fish habitat. Fire exclusion and livestock grazing have allowed canopy cover to increase, which has reduced the understory herbaceous cover. Aspen is present in pure stands and mixed with subalpine fir; however, most stands are dying out or being replaced by conifers. Older aspen stands are not regenerating. Many of the conifer stands in the area are old, with high tree densities and increasing mortality from insects and disease. Fire hazard is increasing in conifer stands. The Pinyon-Juniper group is functioning at high risk due to fire exclusion and grazing impacts that have allowed older, close-canopied stands to dominate, with fewer younger trees and herbaceous plants than desirable. Terrestrial habitat is functioning at risk in localized areas due to impacts to habitat from fire exclusion and introduced plant species.  • Important Ecological Values: The three subwatersheds support some of the last genetically pure Yellowstone cutthroat populations in the Raft River drainage. Cottam cinquefoil and Grouse Creek rockcress, Region 4 Sensitive species, are found in this area.  The cool sagebrush, grasslands, and forests provide habitat for sage grouse, while dry forests at lower elevations provide habitat for the Region 4 sensitive goshawk, and Townsend's big-eared bat.  	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2017	 	 	 	Y

There has been an increase in wildfires with moderate/high burn severity (2011 Beale Fire, 2010 Eagle Rock Fire, 2009 Marteen Fire, and 2000 Pumpkin Fire). Unstable volcanic soils have undergone recurring severe erosion on steeper slopes within burned areas, causing damage to the trails and Forest Service roads and increasing sediment loads in drainages. Soils in the high burn severity areas are expected to take many more years to fully re-stabilize. Forest conditions are contributing to an increased risk of insects and diseases.  The watershed has high road density with insufficient road maintenance to prevent adverse water quality impacts.  Infestations of invasive and noxious weeds including bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica) are common in the watershed.  There is potential overgrazing by cattle in wet meadows near Spring Valley Cabin, East Elk Spring, and West Elk Spring.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Arizona Department of Environmental Qual</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Arizona Game and Fish Dept.</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Coconino County Public Works</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Noxious Weeds Mitigation Contractors</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Arizona Wildlife Federation</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/12/2011	12/31/2016	7	3752000	 	Y

Entire stands of lodgepole are infested with mountain pine beetles and the mortality is increasing the potential fire risk.   Infestations are spreading into other stands of lodgepole pine.  The recent absence of fire within these watersheds is also another major concern.  With the amount of dead trees now found in these watersheds, the implication of a larger more severe fire is imminent when the dead trees fall and increase fuel loads.  The lack of fire in aspen has allowed conifer to encroach within the existing stands.  The conifer encroached aspen stands are critical for big game forage and without the fire to regenerate these stands, critical forage is being lost.  Fire would also benefit the Whitebark Pine stands, these stands are currently in decline due to competition from other vegetation, disease, and loss of ability to reproduce due to lack of fire. Portions of the southern end of the watershed area have suitable brood rearing sage grouse habitat.   These areas of sagebrush tend to be older and more decadent and introducing fire back into these areas could improve this sage grouse habitat.  Lastly, there have been some historical impacts due to sheep grazing.  Some areas that were heavily grazed historically are eroded and gullies have formed.  These areas have been identified and could benefit from gully plugging, seeding, and other restoration type projects. Current grazing impacts have been documented where trailing occurs along Indian Creek, Hams Fork River, West Fork Hams Fork, and in certain areas of the uplands.  Grazing cattle and dispersed camping have aided in the spread of invasive plants such as Canada thistle.   Roads located within these watersheds cross many streams and are under-developed for the amount of use they can receive.  Due to the placement and high use, riparian areas are heavily impacted through crossings and sediment inputs.	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2021	 	 	 	Y

Land management activities and natural disturbances have created conditions that have over time changed riparian communities to xeric vegetation communities such as sagebrush. Rangeland health was declining until 2008 when the Forest started implementing projects that have in some areas started watershed recovery. Rangeland vegetation communities are declining in aerial extent and land is being lost to accelerated erosion. Suitable forage for terrestrial wildlife and grazing animals has a significant departure from desired condition. Water quality impairments include water temperature and sedimentation. Habitat for the TES spotted frog has declined and until 2005 was declining in aerial extent. Soil productivity is impaired and soil erosion rates are above natural background levels. Expansion of Pinyon and Juniper has increased the risk for high intensity wildfire effects. Indian Creek is the headwaters to Reese River Basin which is a municipal watershed for Austin, and occasionally flows to the Humboldt River. The watershed has wet meadow environments that are rare but very important environments in the Great Basin, they account for a large percentage of the region’s biodiversity and have been decreasing in aerial extent in response to channel incision. The watershed serves as important habitat for Columbia spotted frog, Lahontan cutthroat trout, and pygmy rabbit.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Fish and Wildlife Service</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Nevada Department of Environmental Prote</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Nevada Department of Wildlife</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	12/31/2015	7	300000	 	Y

We are working with numerous partners, including the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, to protect and improve conditions in watershed by controlling invasive species, acquiring conservation easements or public ownership of lakeshore, and restoring upland forest conditions.  Ongoing work will continue to reduce road densities, treat fuels, reestablish pine forest communities, reduce aquatic fragmentation and diversify riparian vegetation conditions.  This watershed is situated in the heart of Minnesota’s lake country and contains some of the most pristine natural resources in Minnesota. This watershed has a very high degree of biodiversity.  One-half of Minnesota’s naturally producing Muskie lakes and a quarter of the natural Muskie habitat in the United States is located in the watershed.  Forests in the watershed boast the largest number of breeding eagle pairs in the lower 48 states, as well as many other healthy wildlife populations. The State Action Plan for Minnesota Wildlife identified 89  “species of greatest conservation need” including 29 species that are federal or state endangered, threatened, or of special concern within the watershed.  Currently, the watershed meets surface water quality standards for conventional parameter impairments (not including mercury).  However, these resources are experiencing increased pressure from development and subsequent loss of shoreline and aquatic habitat. The surface water resources within this watershed are highly prized for their recreational value and these resources attract several thousand vacationers to the area each year. The protection of these resources is vital in sustaining the natural heritage and character of this watershed.

Poorer conditions are also due to impacts from irrigation diversions, roads, channelization, and grazing on private land. Most streams are de-watered in the lower reaches during the irrigation season, severely impacting fish habitat. Fire exclusion and livestock grazing have allowed canopy cover to increase, which has reduced the understory herbaceous cover. Aspen is present in pure stands and mixed with subalpine fir; however, most stands are dying out or being replaced by conifers. Older aspen stands are not regenerating. Many of the conifer stands in the area are old, with high tree densities and increasing mortality from insects and disease. Fire hazard is increasing in conifer stands. The Pinyon-Juniper group is functioning at high risk due to fire exclusion and grazing impacts that have allowed older, close-canopied stands to dominate, with fewer younger trees and herbaceous plants than desirable. Terrestrial habitat is functioning at risk in localized areas due to impacts to habitat from fire exclusion and introduced plant species.  • Important Ecological Values: The three subwatersheds support some of the last genetically pure Yellowstone cutthroat populations in the Raft River drainage.

Poorer conditions are also due to impacts from irrigation diversions, roads, channelization, and grazing on private land. Most streams are de-watered in the lower reaches during the irrigation season, severely impacting fish habitat. Fire exclusion and livestock grazing have allowed canopy cover to increase, which has reduced the understory herbaceous cover. Aspen is present in pure stands and mixed with subalpine fir; however, most stands are dying out or being replaced by conifers. Older aspen stands are not regenerating. Many of the conifer stands in the area are old, with high tree densities and increasing mortality from insects and disease. Fire hazard is increasing in conifer stands. The Pinyon-Juniper group is functioning at high risk due to fire exclusion and grazing impacts that have allowed older, close-canopied stands to dominate, with fewer younger trees and herbaceous plants than desirable. Terrestrial habitat is functioning at risk in localized areas due to impacts to habitat from fire exclusion and introduced plant species.  • Important Ecological Values: The three subwatersheds support some of the last genetically pure Yellowstone cutthroat populations in the Raft River drainage. Cottam cinquefoil and Grouse Creek rockcress, Region 4 Sensitive species, are found in this area.  The cool sagebrush, grasslands, and forests provide habitat for sage grouse, while dry forests at lower elevations provide habitat for the Region 4 sensitive goshawk, and Townsend's big-eared bat.  	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2017	 	 	 	Y

This watershed is a smaller order watershed, which allows for more success for restoration of surface water and groundwater hydrology, aquatic habitat, riparian vegetation and natural native communities. In addition to 60% Forest Service lands, the Mill Creek watershed includes 1% ownership by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) – known as Bohigian Conservation Area (CA), and the other 39% of the watershed is in private landownership, but most private landowners own large acreage.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Audubon Society of Missouri</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Missouri University of Science and Techn</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Ozark Fly Fishers Inc</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Cave Research Foundation (CRF)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Mill Creek Watershed Coalition (MCWC)</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2017	21	280000	 	Y

The watershed is host to a high biological diversity of wildlife species including grizzly bear, timber wolf, Lynxs, wolverine, elk, mule deer, westslope cutthroat trout, harlequin ducks and pika.  In 2007, the Skyland wildfire burned over one-half of the watershed accelerated the spread of invasive weeds, degrading soil conditions and diminishing biodiversity of the watershed. The Rocky Mountain Travel Plan has been completed and the implementation of road decommissioning is a high forest priority. The L&C plans to continue the road work which will have the benefit of lowering the road densities which will eliminate chronic sediment supplies to streams, slowing the spread of noxious weeds and improve the overall watersheds hydrologic function. Grazing within the watershed has resulted in soil damage, streambank/riparian corridor degradation, degraded westslope cutthroat trout habitat, and the spread of invasive weeds. Native species i.e. cutthroat trout are threatened by rainbow trout hybridization and brook trout competition.

The Watershed Conservation Framework provided guidance for selecting priority watersheds.  Specific guidance was the importance of the participation by partners (local, state, tribal, other Federal agencies and interest groups) in the watershed prioritization process that was both expected and highly encouraged. The Forest has an active National Forest Advisory Board comprised of members from the specified partners listed. This group was active in the development of a landscape restoration strategy for the Black Hills NF. Projects associated with that strategy were identified within an area some refer to as the “Greater Rushmore Area”.  The Iron Creek watershed is located within this larger area. The Forest has requested funds for implementing projects within the Iron Creek watershed based on that strategy. In addition, the WCF provides guidance on prioritizing watersheds that include “high” resource values (pp. 12-13). This watershed contains many of those components:  the Black Elk Wilderness, the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve, a National Scenic Byway and Custer State Park. The area also supports designated USFS Region 2 species and Forest Species of Local Concern. Since the site is located within close proximity to Mount Rushmore, tourism and recreational activities are readily observed within the watershed.  Recognizing values, many projects have been implemented to date. Several more projects have existing Decisions for implementation based on completed environmental analysis. Projects are available for implementation as funding becomes available. The Forest currently has fund requests submitted (Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration and Highway Transportation Aquatic Passage). Partners have funds committed for projects that could be implemented when the FS receives funds.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Capstone LLC</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Pennington County Resource Advisory Comm</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>South Dakota Department of Transportatio</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>South Dakota Back Country Horsemen</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Custer County Weed and Pest</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Custer County Conservation District</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Custer County Resource Advisory Committe</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	10/17/2011	9/30/2016	13	1990158	 	Y

Big Creek drains into the Kings River at Pine Flat Reservoir, which is used to store irrigation water and is a major recreation reservoir in the area.       Watershed Conditions  The watershed is functioning at risk.  Big Creek was first entered in the 1930's with the construction of the Big Creek Road.  This road was later followed by extensive road development on private and public lands in the 1960's and 1980's.  There are approximately 136 miles of road in the watershed.  The Big Creek Watershed has been extensively and intensively managed for timber commodities since the 1930's.  Timber production reached its height in the 1950's when Bretz Mill was in operation in upper Big Creek.  Timber production has been maintained at a steady pace on public and private lands for at least the last 40 years on over 10,000 acres of timber land.  Aquatic Habitat (3.0) Excessive sediment in Big Creek response reaches, known incision and channel erosion in tributaries, riparian recreation sites impacting water quality and channel function.                                                                          Road & Trail Network (2.3) There are approximately 136 miles of road in the watershed, which is considered a high road density.  Several roads and trails are in a degraded condition from a lack of road/trail maintenance and surface water drainage structures.                                                           Soil (1.7) Several soils in the Upper Big Creek watershed are sensitive to soil disturbance including the Holland family of soils.  There are many areas in Holland soils where accelerated erosion has resulted in excessive sedimentation into several channels in the Upper Big Creek watershed.                         Fire Effects & Regime (2.0) There are high fuels on the ground in approximately 50% some areas and potential for high fire severity and high soil burn severity.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Dinkey Collaborative Group</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2016	7	858000	 	Y

Threats to these resources include climate change, riparian vegetation structure and function, aquatic habitat fragmentation, and water quality.  Opportunities have recently been identified during the planning processes for two large vegetation management projects.  Projects to protect and improve watershed conditions include riparian vegetation treatments and planting, fixing road/stream crossing aquatic organism passage barriers, and improving roads at stream crossings to eliminate sedimentation.  Upland vegetation composition and structure would be moved toward a desired condition through various treatments.	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2014	13	1014100	 	Y

Entire stands of lodgepole are infested with mountain pine beetles and the mortality is increasing the potential fire risk.   Infestations are spreading into other stands of lodgepole pine.  The recent absence of fire within these watersheds is also another major concern.  With the amount of dead trees now found in these watersheds, the implication of a larger more severe fire is imminent when the dead trees fall and increase fuel loads.  The lack of fire in aspen has allowed conifer to encroach within the existing stands.  The conifer encroached aspen stands are critical for big game forage and without the fire to regenerate these stands, critical forage is being lost.  Fire would also benefit the Whitebark Pine stands, these stands are currently in decline due to competition from other vegetation, disease, and loss of ability to reproduce due to lack of fire. Portions of the southern end of the watershed area have suitable brood rearing sage grouse habitat.   These areas of sagebrush tend to be older and more decadent and introducing fire back into these areas could improve this sage grouse habitat.  Lastly, there have been some historical impacts due to sheep grazing.  Some areas that were heavily grazed historically are eroded and gullies have formed.  These areas have been identified and could benefit from gully plugging, seeding, and other restoration type projects. Current grazing impacts have been documented where trailing occurs along Indian Creek, Hams Fork River, West Fork Hams Fork, and in certain areas of the uplands.  Grazing cattle and dispersed camping have aided in the spread of invasive plants such as Canada thistle.   Roads located within these watersheds cross many streams and are under-developed for the amount of use they can receive.  Due to the placement and high use, riparian areas are heavily impacted through crossings and sediment inputs.	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2021	3	35000	 	Y

Instream flow water rights are being pursued for Sabino Creek to protect flows. Pima County has a sewage treatment plant upstream from the Wilderness Boundary. The Catalina FireScape project will prepare plans for the treatment of upland vegetation with the watershed to improve and maintain water quantity and water quality parameters.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Arizona Game and Fish Department</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Mount Lemmon Water District</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Sky Island Alliance</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Friends of Sabino Canyon</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	12/31/2016	8	10552500	 	Y

The watershed lies within what was formerly the north half of the Colville Confederated Tribes Reservation and the Colville Tribe has expressed interest in partnering for the overall restoration of the San Poil River of which approximately 80% is on the Reservation.   The river has been a subsistence fishery for the Colville Tribes historically.  In addition, both the Tribes and the Forest Service are interested in recovering the adfluvial and resident populations of interior redband trout and westslope cutthroat trout which are sensitive species.

A secondary concern is water temperature and the SFSR and tributary streams are proposed for 303(d) listing (IDEQ 2011 305b report).  To exacerbate the concerns, the 2007 Cascade Complex Wildfire consumed 85% of the watershed, with 76% having moderate to high fire severities.  Eighty-one percent of the RCAs in the watershed experienced uncharacteristic moderate to high fire severities.    The 2000 SFSR Subbasin Review (USDA FS 2000) and 2002 SFSR Subbasin Assessment (IDEQ 2002) identified key watershed issues and developed recommendations to address those issues.  Common in both analyses was that roads continue to be a major issue affecting water quality.  In the 1960s concerns over sedimentation and fish habitat resulted in the Forest Service having a “moratorium” on any further logging and reducing land disturbing activities in the upper SFSR drainage.  Road densities and Riparian Conservation Area (RCA) road densities are high.    “Although large scale ground disturbing activities are non-existent, the roads built during that time continue to be the dominant source of sediment in the subbasin” (IDEQ 2002).   Anthropogenic sediment levels associated with high road densities, trails and dispersed recreational impacts and the anticipated increase of post-wildfire sediment are expected for the next 10 to 20 years which pose a high risk of negatively affecting water quality.  Due to the importance of the watershed for delivering high quality water, three complex watershed restoration planning efforts have occurred since 2008; the 2009 SFSR Recreation Access Management Project, the 2009 Rice Creek Road Restoration Project, and the 2011 SFSR Resource Management Project.	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2017	5	3760000	 	Y

The watershed improvement effort will involve projects designed to improve forest conditions such as fire regime and forest health, and will also likely include some minor improvements to the transportation network.  Though this effort will improve the rating for individual attributes related to forest health and fire regime, it will probably not change the condition class rating.  This is because the primary driver for the existing condition class rating is related to stream channel conditions and Provo Water District’s water augmentation in the main channel.   Spring Canyon and Shingle Creek are classified as functioning at risk (Class 2). Bark beetle epidemic has killed many conifers and are further at risk due to climate change. Dead conifers are at risk of wildfire and several residences and summer home areas are at risk.  d.

Stream conditions and functions are classified as fair and could be improved both on FS and private lands.  Efforts have been underway to improve these conditions with essential partnership support.  Three main FS roads split off at the lower end of the subwatershed and parallel Jackknife Creek, Squaw Creek, and Deep Creek each extending about 2-5 miles into the subwatershed and all three streams cross the stream in several locations.  The 2011 high flow event caused an administrative closure on the Squaw Creek to avoid unsafe travel conditions (road washouts).  The last 1.6 miles of the Jackknife road accessing a trailhead has been administratively closed since 2006 due to slumps causing blocked access and unsafe conditions.  These and other roads in the subwatershed could be improved for conditions (drainage), locations (avoiding slumps & riparian areas), and stream crossing. Several of these stream crossing have been identified in the 2005 Caribou-Targhee Fisheries AOP survey as undersized with different degrees of aquatic barriers.  There is a 2011/2012 Legacy project underway to address the last 1.6 miles of the Jackknife Road across unstable slopes and trail access.  The project also includes stream restoration on over 20,000 ft of channel aimed at addressing unstable stream condition associated with undersized stream crossing, historic grazing, beaver removal, poor road locations, etc.  In addition private lands in the lower portion of the drainage have two main restoration projects addressing stream conditions, aquatic barriers and diversion.  	 	9/26/2011	9/30/2015	5	1050000	 	Y

Guidance associated with the TMDL implementation plans for both temperature and sediment identify Scriver Creek as requiring reductions in anthropogenic sediment (76% reduction) and temperature (16% reduction).  Road density is high (4.7 mi/mi2) within the Scriver Creek subwatershed. This high road density is impacting the stream condition by contributing excess sediment to the channel, negatively impacting streambank condition, reducing large woody debris recruitment, expanding the drainage network, increasing stream width to depth ratio, reducing pool quality, and fragmenting aquatic habitat.  A US EPA/IDEQ funded road sediment inventory completed by the Boise National Forest (2011, Scriver Creek GRAIP report) identified approximately 2,500 tons/year of road erosion.  Of this amount and estimated 528 tons/year was delivered to streams in the form of fine sediment.  Fire regimes within the Scriver Creek subwatershed have been altered by fire exclusion. Currently, the subwatershed is rated as having an increased potential for both uncharacteristically large and high intensity/severity wildfire. Scriver Creek provides water to a downstream municipal water supply system for the Rivers Pointe Homeowners Association.  There are 3 known and surveyed fish migration barriers (forest road culverts) that fragment approximately 9.5 miles of available fish habitat.  In addition to these three surveyed fish migration barriers, there are three additional culverts that are thought to be aquatic organism barriers.	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2019	8	3076000	 	Y

The key concerns and conditions affecting watershed condition affect only the Southern portion of the L.F. Huntington and the Northern portion of Lowry Water. This includes Reeder Canyon northward to the Miller Flat area. These two sub-watersheds contain both recreation and wetland corridors which are home to 50 percent of the wetlands existing on the Manti-La Sal NF and host some of the heaviest visitation found on the forest. Former State of Utah sections 16 and 32 in T15 South, R6 East contain many of these wetlands.  These sections became part of the National Forest System several years ago, but for decades they were used without restriction by visitors.  Several miles of user created roads and motorized trails in these sections are negatively impacting wetlands. The Lowry Water road (NFSR 50038) closely parallels Lowry Water Creek between Joes Valley and Potters Ponds and has three bridge crossings.  The northern two miles of this road is also directly impacting wetlands and the riparian area.  Both drainages provide water for culinary, industrial, and agricultural uses to Emery County. Collectively, these sub-watersheds have impaired ratings for habitat fragmentation, exotic and invasive species, loss of forest cover, mass wasting, and proximity to water. Fish are prevented from moving freely throughout the Left Fork of Huntington Creek aquatic ecosystem due to several reservoirs located in the Left Fork watershed.  There are little to no projects that could be undertaken to mitigate the impaired condition of habitat fragmentation. Exotic and invasive species within the Left Fork of Huntington Creek aquatic ecosystem is typified by the presence of whirling disease and non-native fish species.  Native fish populations are isolated and protected from exotic and invasive species by barriers. There are no additional projects that could reasonably be undertaken to mitigate this impaired condition.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Campground Hosts</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Utah COnservation Corps</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Utah Division of Wlidlife Resources</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Utah Dedicated Hunters</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	12/31/2015	8	4800000	 	Y

The Pine Creek watershed is downstream of all major impoundments on the Manistee River and is one of only two tributaries capable of providing natural reproduction of steelhead trout. The Manistee River itself provides habitat for Lake Sturgeon within the boundaries of this watershed. The Pine Creek watershed provides important habitat for reptile species, including three RFSS turtle species (wood, box, and spotted turtle) and possibly massasauga rattlesnake. There are three bald eagle territories and several red-shouldered hawk territories within the watershed. The watershed includes a portion of the Tippy Bat Swarming Area, important for several species of bats including the endangered Indiana Bat. There is also suitable habitat within the watershed for golden winged warbler, a species under consideration for ESA listing. Several important partners of the Huron-Manistee, including the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, MI Department of Environmental Quality, Conservation Resource Alliance, and Little River Band of Ottawa Indians have great interest in management to protect and improve both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems within the Pine Creek-Manistee River watershed. Essential projects could be completed in 5 to 8 years depending upon funding availability.

The Hood River Aquatic Restoration Strategy is a basin wide strategy identifying priority watersheds, limiting factors, and priority hilltop-to-valley-bottom restoration actions.  The goal of the strategy was to address aquatic habitat restoration needs for fish species, stream flow, and water quality improvements.  This strategy is the foundation for the Upper West Fork Hood River Watershed Restoration Action Plan.  The Upper west Fork Hood River (UWFHR) watershed is a priority watershed because: 1) The UWFHR supports summer steelhead and spring Chinook salmon.  Spring Chinook salmon are listed as threatened under the ESA and are culturally important to the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation (CTWS).  The population of summer steelhead is one of a few remnant wild populations remaining in the Lower Columbia River basin.  2) The watershed is the primary focus of multi-agency restoration efforts with strong partnerships and strong financial commitments.  3) The UWFHR is a priority for the CTWS because it is the stronghold for spring Chinook salmon production.  Due to the agreement between Columbia River tribes and BPA, the CTWS has a long term source of funding for habitat restoration, fish population supplementation, and population monitoring.  4) Western Rivers Conservancy is working in partnership with the MHNF to acquire an 1872 acre private parcel in the UWFHR.  Upon acquisition, Western Rivers Conservancy will make the parcel available to the Forest Service, which includes three miles of spawning and rearing habitat for listed fish.  5) Several restoration projects identified in the 2006 Hood River Basin Aquatic Restoration Strategy have already been completed and there is strong momentum.             .                                                 	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Hood River Soil and Water Conservation D</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Long View Timber</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Oregon Department of Environmental Quali</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Western Rivers Conservancy</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Middle Fork Irrigation District</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Hood River Watershed Group</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Hood River County</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>

The watershed improvement effort will involve projects designed to improve forest conditions such as fire regime and forest health, and will also likely include some minor improvements to the transportation network.  Though this effort will improve the rating for individual attributes related to forest health and fire regime, it will probably not change the condition class rating.  This is because the primary driver for the existing condition class rating is related to stream channel conditions and Provo Water District’s water augmentation in the main channel.   Spring Canyon and Shingle Creek are classified as functioning at risk (Class 2). Bark beetle epidemic has killed many conifers and are further at risk due to climate change. Dead conifers are at risk of wildfire and several residences and summer home areas are at risk.  d.

More hillslope sediment than normal has become mobilized during precipitation events as a result of the Corn Creek fire in 2008. • Fish habitat fragmentation: The Birch Creek drainage is the southernmost drainage on the west side of the Colorado River to contain native Colorado River cutthroat trout (CRCT) populations.  CRCT are an Intermountain Region (R4) Sensitive species and are managed under a Conservation Agreement and Strategy to which R4 is a signatory.  Habitat modification by, and negative interactions with, invasive species have caused population declines and are threatening the existence of native fish communities in the watershed. Until recently native Colorado River cutthroat trout were thought to be restricted to Water Canyon creek and a small portion of Birch Creek; however CRCT were recently found in Hall Creek, as well.  Habitat fragmentation within the watershed, as well as the rest of the Escalante River drainage, appears to be the primary reason that CRCT are isolated to portions of the watershed.  Within the Birch Creek drainage, historic CCC era check dams on Water Canyon Creek and Birch Creek restrict and prevent movement in portions of these streams.  In addition the recently discovered population in Hall Creek is isolated by a perched culvert on Forest Highway 17 and an additional culvert on FR30150.  • Travel Management: Roads are the biggest contributor to soil displacement within the watershed, as they intercept natural water flow and cause road prism erosion.  Road maintenance efforts within the watershed are lacking over the last 25 years, resulting in blocked culverts and poorly functioning road drainage structures, which further complicate sedimentation issues.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Escalante River Watershed Partnership</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Trout Unlimited</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	10/1/2013	6	1700000	 	Y

Specific concerns include: Private and commercial recreational stock use Dispersed camping sites and recreation use along streams and lakeshores Developed recreation sites. Vegetation/fuels Housing and other developments within the urban/wildland interface have increased the risk and consequences of wildfire. The extent, distribution, and connectivity of old forest stands have been impacted by the absence of fire and historic logging. The exclusion of natural fire has altered historic fire regimes throughout the watershed. This has resulted in denser timber stands, higher fuel loadings, and the invasion of non-fire resistant species, all of which have increased the risk of large stand replacing fires and threats to cultural resources, wildlife, water quality, scenic quality, and facilities. Invasive weeds on National Forest System lands and adjacent federal, state, and private lands can alter natural ecosystems. Wildlife, Fisheries and riparian habitat quality has decreased. Special Uses/Lands, the U.S. Marine Corps, Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) is located on National Forest System Lands in the watershed. Roads, the road system needs review and adjustment. The highest priority for road management is to improve the road and trail system to reduce impacts to stream channels, riparian areas, and water quality. Grazing, rangeland vegetation communities are declining in aerial extent and land is being lost to accelerated erosion. Suitable forage for terrestrial wildlife and grazing animals has a significant departure from desired condition.	 	9/30/2011	12/31/2015	4	251000	 	Y

Primary concern is with a seven mile long primitive road segment in the watershed created prior to wilderness designation.  This road was used to transport heavy equipment during construction of dams in the 1950’s to facilitate irrigation in the lower valleys.  Numerous segments of this road are on steep slopes and/or lack drainage features to prevent capture of streams and overland storm flow.  Restoration efforts to narrow the tread and correct erosion problems with this system trail would reduce sediment transport to area streams, reduce soil loss, and improve the wilderness character of the watershed.  Approximately 2.5 miles of system trail elsewhere in the watershed have also been identified as needing improvement to correct problems related to water drainage or accelerated soil erosion.

The three main conditions contributing to the functioning at risk classification include; loss of ecosystem health caused by a wide spread beetle epidemic, introduced non-native fish species threatening native bull trout populations, and heavy recreation pressure including need for trail maintenance and OHV use management.  The Sawmill area is currently experiencing a Douglas-fir bark beetle and spruce budworm epidemic. The watershed has experienced a large buildup of forest fuels and change in vegetation composition and structure. Exceptionally dense stands are undergoing intense completion for limited amounts of water, nutrients, and sunlight. These conditions, in combination with recent long-term drought, have led to recent and ongoing insect epidemics and high intensity wildfires around the project area. The development of mid to late-seral stand structures and species composition favors conifer species over aspen. As a result, aspen stands are declining reducing the diversity and overall resiliency of the ecosystem.  Introduced brook trout appear to be a major threat to bull trout (Endangered Species Act Threatened species) populations in the Little Lost River basin.  The Sawmill Canyon sub-watershed upstream from, and including, Iron Creek contains approximately 22 miles of occupied bull trout habitat and approximately 95% of the bull trout found in the Little Lost River basin. Additional assessments have concluded that brook trout will completely replace bull trout within the next 50 years if management action is not taken.	 	9/29/2011	9/30/2014	4	273000	 	Y

General road maintenance activities, road drainage reconstruction for aquatic fish passage (culvert replacement, over-side drainage repair, etc.), and road decommissioning work has been identified and is needed within this watershed.  This watershed contains invasive starthistle and invasive Sacramento Perch.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Cultural Resource Site Stewards </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Kings Canyon National Park</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>local fire safe council </Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>State OHV</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2015	10	1726000	 	Y

This is a bull trout priority watershed and one of the two most important bull trout areas in the larger Thompson River system.   Improvements will directly benefit bull trout populations and will improve water quality for the West Fork Fishtrap Creek as well as downstream reaches of Fishtrap Creek (habitat, sediment and temperature).	 	10/28/2011	10/1/2015	4	225000	 	Y

Many of the roads within the area have been in place since the early logging era where they have contributed to changes in drainage patterns, increased sediment loads, fish passage problems, and loss of riparian habitat.  This watershed provides one the greatest diversity of watershed improvement projects on Forest.  In addition the watershed is adjacent to another priority watershed on Forest, Twentymile Creek.  These two watersheds offer the best opportunity to collaborate efforts with the Bad River Watershed Association who is in the process of finalizing their HUC 5 Marengo River watershed action plan.  The watershed is located within the Great Lakes basin.  	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Bad River Watershed Association</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2016	22	2175200	 	Y

Approximately 37% of the existing roads, dispersed camp sites, and trails are within 300 feet of water.  General road maintenance activities, road drainage reconstruction (culvert replacement, over-side drainage repair, etc.), and road decommissioning work has been identified and is needed within this watershed.  Road related aquatic organism passage problems also exist which are resulting in increased habitat fragmentation and decreases in hydrologic connectivity.  These factors are negatively influencing several meadows and streams at road interfaces.   Historic logging in conjunction with the McNally Fire of 2002 has reduced large tree attributes in forest stands around Johnsondale.  Areas burned in the McNally Fire perimeter should be reforested to set a timelier path to desired future condition.  The watershed contains valuable cultural resource (both historic and pre-historic), and contains portions of two giant sequoia groves.  Fire is a threat to all of these resources plus the watershed.  	 	9/30/2011	9/30/2016	8	5970000	 	Y

Additionally the Watershed is also in the core of Missouri’s most forested/wooded landscape and Mark Twain National Forest’s least fragmented ranger district, the Eleven Point Ranger District.  The Current River is a major destination for recreation, including the National Park Service Ozark Scenic Area, Missouri State Parks, and Missouri Department of Conservation, Conservation Areas.In the Current River Watershed there are 22 HUC-6 watersheds with greater than 5% ownership of MTNF lands. Work in multiple watersheds by multiple organizations is occurring, however, the plan for the entire Current River watershed area would span beyond a 5 year scope of work. The focus of landscape restoration work for MTNF will be focused on 4 watersheds (below). These watersheds include: high MTNF Ownership, projects ready to be implemented with the next 3-5 years, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration proposal (CFLRP) area, and partnership interest. The list of project request for funding focus on projects that do not traditionally get Forest Service Funding. 	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>CHJV</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>The Nature Conservancy</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>US Fish and Wildlife Service</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>ONSR</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>LAD Foundation</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Missouri Department of Conservation</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Missouri Department of Natural Resources</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Natural Resources Conservation Service</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	9/30/2011	9/30/2017	11	2217500	 	Y

The majority of the watershed is in Fire Regime Condition Class 3 and is at risk of uncharacteristically large, high-severity, stand replacing wildfire that could adversely affect the City of Williams.  Forest conditions are also contributing to an increased risk of insects and diseases, particularly mistletoe infection.  Juniper encroachment into grassland ecosystems have resulted in decreased vegetative ground cover in some areas, increasing the risk of soil erosion. The watershed has high road density (3.26 mi./sq. mi.) with insufficient road maintenance to prevent adverse surface water quality impacts.	<Known_Partners><Partner><Name>Arizona Dept of Environmental Quality</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner><Partner><Name>Arizona Game and Fish Dept.</Name><Type>Known</Type></Partner></Known_Partners>	12/30/2011	12/31/2016	6	4350000	 	Y
