    <descript>
      <abstract>A streamflow data set, which is specifically suitable for the study of
surface-water conditions throughout the United States under fluctuations
in the prevailing climatic conditions, has been developed.  This data set,
called the Hydro-Climatic Data Network, or HCDN, consists of streamflow
records for 1,659 sites throughout United States and its Territories.</abstract>
      <purpose>The potential consequences of climate change to continental water
resources are of great concern in the management of those resources.
Critically important to society is what effect fluctuations in the
prevailing climate may have on hydrologic conditions, such as the
occurrence and magnitude of floods or droughts and the seasonal
distribution of water supplies within a region.
		
Records of streamflow that are unaffected by artificial diversions,
storage, or other works of man in or on the natural stream channels or
in the watershed can provide an account of hydrologic responses to
fluctuations in climate.  By examining such records given known past
meteorologic conditions, we can better understand hydrologic responses
to those conditions and anticipate the effects of postulated changes in
current climate regimes.  Furthermore, patterns in streamflow records
can indicate when a change in the prevailing climate regime may have
occurred in the past, even in the absence of concurrent meteorologic
records.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Records for the HCDN were obtained through a comprehensive search of the
extensive surface-water data holdings of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
which are contained in the USGS National Water Storage and Retrieval
System (WATSTORE).  All streamflow discharge records in WATSTORE through
September 30, 1988, were examined for inclusion in the HCDN in accordance
with strictly defined criteria of measurement accuracy and natural
conditions.  No reconstructed records of "natural flow" were permitted,
nor was any record extended or had missing values "filled in" using
computational algorithms.  If the streamflow at a station was judged to
be free of controls for only a part of the entire period of record that
is available for the station, then only that part was included in the HCDN,
but only if it was of sufficient length (generally 20 years) to warrant
inclusion.
		
In addition to the daily mean discharge values, complete station
identification information and basin characteristics were retrieved from
WATSTORE for inclusion in the HCDN.  Statistical characteristics,
including the monthly mean discharge, as well as the annual mean, minimum
and maximum discharge values, were derived for the records in the HCDN
data set.
		
The HCDN includes data values for discharge measured at 1,659 streamflow
gaging stations.  Records cumulatively span the period 1874 through 1988,
inclusive, and represent a total of 73,231 water years of information.
