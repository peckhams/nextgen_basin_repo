MOPEX was (or is) an international collaborative project with a focus
on collecting data for river basins with minimal human impact for the
chief purpose of hydrologic model calibration.

NOAA's URL for the MOPEX project is:
   https://hydrology.nws.noaa.gov/pub/gcip/mopex/
and the URL for the US MOPEX data is:
   https://hydrology.nws.noaa.gov/pub/gcip/mopex/US_Data/

At one point, data was distributed on a DVD as described here:
   https://hydrology.nws.noaa.gov/pub/gcip/mopex/US_Data/Documentation/

Expanded datasets for 431 US MOPEX basins was provided by the 2009
Hydrologic Synthesis Project.  See Sivapalan_et_al_2010.pdf in the
Papers folder for more info.

I obtained all the data for the 2009 Hydrologic Sythesis project from
Matej Durcik (SAHRA Center and University of Arizona)
    https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/mdurcik.
This included a subfolder called MOPEX431 which has been included in
the MOPEX/Data folder.

This folder has 2 shapefiles, one for basins and one for outlets.
The 431 refers to the number of MOPEX basins.  The attribute tables for
both shapefiles include the longitude and latitude of the outlet.
(See the Comment column.)  Lons and lats are given to 4 digits after the
decimal, which corresponds to about 11 meters of precision at the equator. 
See this Wikipedia article for details:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees  (Precision section)
Some outlets appear to be outside (or inside, vs. on) the basin polygon.

Berghuijs et al. (2014) used data for 321 of the 431 US MOPEX basins for
their paper on the Seasonal Water Balance (process-based) method for
basin classification.  But which specific basins were used (or excluded)
is no longer known/available (Berghuijs, personal communication).
