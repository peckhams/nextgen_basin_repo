USGS GAGES-II dataset is quite extensive and provides data for 9,322 USGS
stream gages that are active and/or have 20+ complete years of discharge
data between 1950 and 2009.  It includes 2057 "reference" (least-disturbed)
sites and 7265 "non-reference" sites.  It also includes all but 7 of the
MOPEX basins.  A further subset of 1947 "selected basins, version 3" has
additional attributes and includes all CAMELS basins and 743 of the 1639
HCDN basins.  See papers in the Papers folder, including Falcone (2011)
and Over et al. (2018) for more info.

The main GAGES-II dataset can be downloaded from:

The GAGES-II Selected Basins version 3 dataset can be downloaded from:

GAGES-II also includes shapefiles for basin boundaries.

The file topoflow/utils/ngen/gages2_utils.py has many utilities for
working with these GAGES-II datasets.  That source code files also contains
additional information in comments.
